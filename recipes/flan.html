    <p>"Flan" can refer to a couple different things depending on where you live. In this case, it's a baked custard dessert topped with caramel. The Spanish dessert is similar to the French cr√®me caramel. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White Sugar - 1 Cup</li>
        <li>Large Eggs - 3</li>
        <li>Sweetened Condensed Milk - 14 ounces</li>
        <li>Evaporated Milk - 12 fluid ounces</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract - 1 Tablespoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside. </li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough hot water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after 55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it cools. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer baking dish to a wire rack; cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 3 days. </li>
        <li>To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let caramel sauce flow over flan. </li>
    </ol>
